README â€“ Smart City Traffic Management System (SCTMS)
Title: Smart City Traffic Management System (SCTMS)
Subject: Computer Aptitude (Code: 25CAP-607)
Aim: To create a smart system that controls traffic lights dynamically using real-time data.
Objective: To analyze traffic flow and optimize signal timing for smooth movement.
Language Used: C++ (for simulation and logic)
Database Concept: SQL-based schema for data storage and management.
Main Logic: Compares vehicle counts from each direction and adjusts signal duration automatically.
Tools Used: C++ Compiler (Code::Blocks / GCC) and MySQL/PostgreSQL for database design.
Output: Displays current signal states and dynamically adjusted timings.
Conclusion: The system reduces waiting time, prevents congestion, and supports smart city traffic control.
Learning Outcome: Learned real-time simulation, dynamic algorithm design, and database integration in C++.
